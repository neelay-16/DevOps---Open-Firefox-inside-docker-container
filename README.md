Open Firefox inside docker container

# Start docker services and launch a container 
Launching a container in Docker involves using the docker run command followed by the name of the container image you want to run.
Docker will create an isolated instance of the image, known as a container, which runs as a separate process with its own file system and network stack. You can customize the container's behavior with various options, such as specifying ports to expose, environment variables, and volumes to mount. Once launched, you can interact with the container, view its logs, and manage it using Docker commands. Containers are lightweight, efficient, and can run consistently across different environments, making Docker a popular choice for application deployment and testing.

It's important to note that running graphical applications inside Docker containers may require additional setup, such as configuring X11 forwarding or using tools like VNC to access the graphical interface. Also, you should be mindful of the potential security implications of running a web browser inside a container, as it can introduce attack vectors if not properly secured.
